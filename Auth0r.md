## Solution:

According to the description, we need to find the site of this challenge author (**U!B_Sidhartha**).

I tired searching for (UiB Sidhartha) in some social media sites, and I found his Twitter account and his Instagram account.

Nice! The author site is there. (www.theuib.live)

The flag was in a hidden directory which you could find in the home page source, and it's (/hacsecurity)

## Solution:

We are given a CVE id in the description (**CVE-2007-3561**), and we need to find the author blog name.

(**I think they meant the name of the vulnerable blog software**)

<br/><br/>

There are a lot of sites to view CVE vulnerability details, and (www.cvedetails.com) is one of them.

<br/><br/>

So, I searched for (**CVE-2007-3561**) in (www.cvedetails.com)

https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2007-3561/

And the affected product was a blog software called "**Efendy Blog**"

## Solution:

First of all, I searched for Evan Williams

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

That's interesting, I might need to search in Twitter, Blogger or Medium.

<br/><br/>

And I have something in the description that looks like a username (**blogpost1**).

<br/><br/>


So, I searched for **blogpost1** in Twitter, Blogger and Medium.

- I didn't find anything in Twitter.
- In Blogger, I found an old blog, from 2005, so it's not useful.
- In Medium, I found something interesting. (https://medium.com/@blogpost1)

So, what I need to do is to find the name of the hotel he is staying at.

Also, he said that it will take approximately 5â€“6 minutes for him to reach the hotel from that store (**Bonanza Gift Shop**).

<br/><br/>

Using Google Maps, I found a hotel called **The STRAT Hotel**,

and it takes approximately 5 minutes to reach from **Bonanza Gift Shop** to that hotel.

And that was the flag.
